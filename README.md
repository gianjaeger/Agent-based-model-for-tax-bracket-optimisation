# Agent-based-model-for-tax-bracket-optimisation

The following script was compiled for a project in the class "Frontiers of Social Data Science" taught by Dr Carl Benedikt Frey at the Oxford Internet Institute.

The model simulates an economy with 100 heterogeneous agents whose behavior the central planner adjusts its tax brackets to. Agents choose to relocate if their expected utility is higher abroad. The simulation converges at a tax schedual that maximises government revenue whilst minimizing the emigration of high-income earners.
